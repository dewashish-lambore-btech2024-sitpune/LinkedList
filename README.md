Here’s a comprehensive README for all your linked list programs, written in a clean and plagiarism-safe way:

# Linked List Implementation in C++

## Overview

This project demonstrates **basic linked list concepts** in C++ including:

* Creating nodes using a class
* Linking nodes to form a list
* Traversing and displaying the list
* Inserting nodes at the head of the list

The examples range from a **single node** to **multi-node lists** with dynamic insertion.

---

## Programs Included

### 1. Single Node Creation

* Demonstrates creation of a single node using a class.
* Shows the node's value and next pointer.
* Concepts introduced:

  * Dynamic memory allocation with `new`
  * Node structure with a value and a pointer to the next node

**Key Code Snippet:**

```cpp
Node* n = new Node(20);
cout << n->data << " " << n->next << endl;
```

---

### 2. Multi-node Linked List

* Creates multiple nodes and links them together.
* Traverses the list from head to tail.
* Displays all node values in order.

**Key Concepts:**

* Linking nodes using pointers
* Traversing the list using a temporary pointer

**Traversal Example:**

```cpp
Node* temp = head;
while (temp != nullptr) {
    cout << temp->data << " ";
    temp = temp->next;
}
```

---

### 3. Insertion at Head

* Demonstrates inserting new nodes at the beginning of the linked list.
* Updates the head pointer after each insertion.
* Displays the updated list after each insertion.

**Key Concepts:**

* Head pointer manipulation
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Updating the next pointers correctly

**Insertion Example:**

```cpp
Node* newNode = new Node(val);
newNode->next = head;
head = newNode;
```

---

## Class Structure

```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

* `data` → stores the value of the node
* `next` → pointer to the next node in the list
* Constructor initializes the node value and sets `next` to `nullptr`

---

## Features

* Dynamic memory allocation for nodes
* Easy insertion at head
* Traversal and display of linked list
* Demonstrates basic linked list structure for beginners

---

## Real-Life Applications

* Dynamic memory structures in software (stacks, queues, graphs)
* Undo/Redo functionality in text editors
* Memory-efficient data storage for unknown-size collections
* Implementation of adjacency lists in graph algorithms

---

## Execution Instructions

1. Copy the code into a `.cpp` file.
2. Compile using any C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o linkedlist
   ```
3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./linkedlist
   ```
4. Observe the output showing linked list nodes and insertion operations.

---

## Notes

* Always free dynamically allocated memory (not included in simple examples for clarity).
* `nullptr` is used instead of `NULL` for modern C++ standards.

Do you want me to also create a **diagram of linked list operations** for this README to make it visually clear?
